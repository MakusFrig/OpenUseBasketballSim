Step by step


1 define a player and a few attributes

2 define some functions that calculate what the player will do when they have the ball and when they dont have the ball
 - This could be on the perimeter, on defense etc...

 3 make a visual representation of it


 Advanced  - build plays into it like the pick and roll




 Assume we play 5 out, will implement other formations later

Logic to implement next
 - Distance from basket
    - Affect how much its worth
    - Affect the probability of it going in
